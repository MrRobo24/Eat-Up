# Eat-Up
A food ordering app which covers several android fundamental features and works with Internshala's API. It contains features corresponding to any normal food ordering application. This project was assigned as the capstone project for Internshala's Android Development Course and I have completed it with a score of 97%.

Experimented with resources like:
1. Recycler View
2. Room Library
3. Glide Library
4. Drawer Layout


*Note: All the API tokens are omitted for obvious reasons.
